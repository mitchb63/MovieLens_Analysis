# MovieLens_Analysis
 Hypothesis driven analysis of Kaggle MovieLens data with an examination of limitations and bias.  
 This project was conducted as part of Udacity's Data Visualization Nanodegree program.


## Introduction
The data used is from a Kaggle dataset that contains metadata for 45,000 movies listed in the MovieLens Dataset. The dataset 
consists of movies released on or before July 2017. Data points include cast, crew, plot keywords, budget, revenue, posters, 
release dates, languages, production companies, countries, TMDB vote counts and vote averages.  The dataset also has 26 million 
ratings from 270,000 users for all 45,000 movies. 

The objective of this project was to use the MovieLens dataset and conduct the EDA necessary to understand the dataset as a whole. 
The goal will be to discover if the dataset is balanced, if there are anomalies in the dataset that affect the applicability of the 
recommendation, and the creation of a final presentation that will be used for recommendations to a management team.

The problem statement for the project was defined as:

** What are the key components that differentiate the top 20% of films from the remainder when considering profit margin? **

Three hypotheses were constructed as the foundation of the study:

*	Story factors influence the filmâ€™s profit margin
*	Production factors influence the profit margin
*	Public opinion factors affect the profit margin


## Findings
```
The key findings of the analysis were that story factors and budget appear to have the greatest influence on the profit margin of a film, 
and the final recommendations were to focus on the production and promotion of films that are part of an ongoing collection and/or films 
with budgets less than approximately $6 million.  These movies were found to be more likely to have profit margins in the top 20% of those 
examined.  The analytic process used, as well as the limitations and biases in the dataset, are described in the sections that follow.
